# aidtech_Create_a_password_generator
Welcome to the official repository for my Java intern task submission at InfoAid Tech! In this repository, you'll find the code and documentation for the task assigned to me during my internship as a Java developer.

Task Description:

The task assigned for this internship involved creating a Java application to demonstrate proficiency in key concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithm implementation. The goal was to develop a robust and efficient solution that showcases my Java programming skills.

Task instruction :

Steps to create the project:

Define the length of the password: Decide on the length of the password that you want to generate.

Define the character set: Decide on the character set you want to use to generate the password. This can include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Create a function to generate the password: Write a function that takes in the length of the password and the character set as parameters and generates a random password.

Use random number generation: Use Java's built-in random number generator to generate random characters from the chosen character set.

Convert the password to a string: Convert the generated password to a string and return it from the function.

Add user input: Add functionality to allow the user to input the desired length of the password and the character set to be used.

Test the program: Test the program by generating passwords of different lengths and using different character sets.
